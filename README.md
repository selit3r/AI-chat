While I wrote this code, I want to make simple AI chat, which can work local on your PC - and I made it. For language model I used
cotype-nano-1.5b from MTS-AI. I didn't upload it, but u can download it from hugging-face. Code working onlu on CPU or CUDA, if
u have AMD card (like me) - text generating can take a while. It's all what I want to say to you, u can use this code in your
projects, but add me in a credits
